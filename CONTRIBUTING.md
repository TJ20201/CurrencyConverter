# Contributing Guide
## Getting started
### Pull Requests
#### Opening Pull Requests
If you want to open a pull request, target the `unstable` branch. This branch is used for development versions and gets pushed into `stable` once a version is finished.
### Issues
#### Create a new Issue
If you find a problem with conversion, check if the issue already exists and if it doesn't then open a new issue and describe your problem.
#### Solving an Issue
If you feel like solving an issue, search through open ones until you find one that you want to fix and you may open a pull request to fix it.
### Changes
#### UI Changes
If you want to make changes to the UI, such as a new button or updating a menu then feel free to open a new pull request for the change if it doesn't exist already.
